Hi, I'm Ima Mervin. I'm a developer and data analyst passionate about building intelligent, data-driven solutions.

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics (Decision Science) at the University of Colorado Boulder , which I'm pairing with my B.A. in Computer Science. This unique combination allows me to not only engineer complex systems but also strategically analyze the "why" behind them.

My expertise is in full-stack development and applied machine learning. I'm proficient in Python , SQL , JavaScript (React.js) , and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. I love turning raw data into actionable insights using tools like Tableau and libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

I've built several full-stack AI projects from the ground up, including an AI-powered interview prep tool that generates personalized feedback and an NLP model that classifies music genres and generates original lyrics. 

I'm driven by innovative problem-solving  and a passion for creating applications that are both functional and insightful.

Take a look at my projects below, and let's build something impactful together.
