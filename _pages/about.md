<!-- 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi, I'm Ima Mervin. I'm a developer and data analyst passionate about building intelligent, data-driven solutions.

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics (Decision Science) at the University of Colorado Boulder , which I'm pairing with my B.A. in Computer Science. This unique combination allows me to not only engineer complex systems but also strategically analyze the "why" behind them.

My expertise is in full-stack development and applied machine learning. I'm proficient in Python , SQL , JavaScript (React.js) , and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. I love turning raw data into actionable insights using tools like Tableau and libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

I've built several full-stack AI projects from the ground up, including an AI-powered interview prep tool that generates personalized feedback and an NLP model that classifies music genres and generates original lyrics. 

I'm driven by innovative problem-solving  and a passion for creating applications that are both functional and insightful.

Take a look at my projects below, and let's build something impactful together.
